# TrogdorTheBurninator
Trogdor Themed Text-Based Game in Python

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The goal of this project was to create a text-based game where the user could move between objects, collect items, and defeat a villain.

# What did you do particularly well?
I got creative with this one and went Trogdor-themed. The code is well-formatted and will be easy for anyone to read.
  

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Maybe structure the dictionaries differently to make tracking a little more intuitive. Possibly implement as a class instead of just random functions.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The dictionaries. Getting the right piece of info was challenging at first.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Proper code structuring and syntax.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Broke the code out into modular functions to be used when needed.
